# Collection of helper libraries for Go #

## Introduction ##

This repository stores a collection of mostly unrelated helper libraries.
Functionality that the author (Joe Tsai) found common among his various projects
are pulled out and placed here.

## Packages ##

* [bufpipe](http://godoc.org/bitbucket.org/rawr/golib/bufpipe): A hybrid between
a byte buffer and a pipe. In many ways, it operates like an io.Pipe.
* [errs](http://godoc.org/bitbucket.org/rawr/golib/errs): Helpful functions for
dealing with errors.
* [ioutil](http://godoc.org/bitbucket.org/rawr/golib/ioutil): Collection of io
related functionality similar to what is found in package io and package bytes.
