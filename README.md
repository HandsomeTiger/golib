# Collection of helper libraries for Go #

## Introduction ##

This repository stores a collection of mostly unrelated helper libraries.
Functionality that the author (Joe Tsai) found common among his various projects
are pulled out and placed here.

## Packages ##

* bufpipe: A hybrid between a byte buffer and a pipe. In many ways, it operates
in a similar fashion as io.Pipe.
* errs: Helpful functions for dealing with errors.
